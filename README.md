# Imitation Learning for compressing MPC.
This repo contains an implementation of using imitation learning to copy the behavior of an mpc. \
To make the implementation easier (bypass version conflicts and etc), we borrowed several utility functions from:\
[Stable Baseline3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
and [Tao Chen's repo](https://github.com/taochenshh/easyrl)
